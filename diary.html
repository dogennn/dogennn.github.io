<h1>JOURNAL</h1>
<p>If I decide to write inside of it, this will be my journal. This will log what happens in days of my life, my thoughts, etc.</p>
<p>August 24th, 2018.
School is starting on Monday. I'm excited, but worried at the same time. High School isn't going to be anything like Middle School. I'm enrolled in 2 Pre-AP classes, and Algebra II/Trig, so there will be homework every single day. The good thing is that I am pretty good and familiar with those two subjects (Biology and World History I). The main challenges for me will be doing English Homework and learning brand new material in Alg II/Trig. I can already feel the anxiety building up inside of my stomach as I think about what my teachers might be like. I know for a fact that in High School the vast majority of teachers could care less about your grades or wellbeing, so I have to suck it up and make sure that I take care of myself in High School. I have many buddies to accompany me on this autistic adventure, and I think that I will survive.
One thing that makes me anxious is another element of High School, love. I'm going to unload my thought process here, so it won't be grammatically correct and won't flow like a normal writing. I really like a girl. I think that she likes me back a little bit. I don't know if I'm still her crush, but it was definitely so before Middle School ended. Every single day in Band Class, she would look behind her (she's a flute) and take every chance to catch a glimpse of me. I noticed this immediately because I often do that to my crushes as well. I never thought that in my life someone would genuinely think I was cute or like me because of my appearance. The only time I've been complimented in physical appearance was from my family members, and the word used was 'handsome'. My self-esteem for my physical appearance is low, so logically, this should be a platonic crush, right?
I'm a straight-A student, I'm nice, I take care of myself, and I swim. Ideally, this would make me a good person to be in a relationship or be friends with, but I would never think that people would be attracted to me because of my appearance or looks. I might have ruined my reputation earlier in Middle School, because from 6th to 7th grade, I would always keep a straight face, with unenthusiastic looking eyes. I didn't do this on purpose, it was just in my genes. My family members are masters at the deadpan expression, or the 'don't talk to me' expression. Of course, it doesn't help that I don't show any outward emotion, so you can't even tell what I am thinking or how happy I am. That being said, I'm almost never consistently happy, but that's just my personality. I usually think logically, with a cause-and-effect way of thinking. It's very easy for me to see the outcomes
of an event before it even happens. I take information that I learn and observe, and I use it to elaborate on my cause-and-effect thinking. Because of this, I am very good at reading people online, and in real life. It's easy for me to predict what they are going to do, so I can predict my enemy's movements in videogames before they even think about moving like that. Due to my ability of reading people, I feel like I can sympathize with people more easily than others. By looking at a person's face, I can (usually) tell what they are feeling, and even feel it myself. My outward appearance is deceptive, and because of that, many people don't have the opportunity to see what's inside. I'm socially awkward as well, so even if I want to do something or interact with a person, I can't, because either: I'm too nervous, I don't know what to say or do once I'm there, or I don't want to.
I have now realized what this writing has become. Initially, it was me talking about school and what I might do in school, but now it's shifted off into me talking about myself. That's another issue that I have. I'm so blessed in life and I have so many things to be thankful for, that I can't help but rave about myself or my own accomplishments. I don't rave about my accomplishments that I don't have, because that would be very stupid, but I can turn any conversation and kill it by starting to talk about myself. Soemtimes, I do this pathologically, without even noticing it. I'm even doing it right now! I need to stop talking about what I can do, and about other things. This website might be about me, but I don't want to look like an arrogant retard who knows basic HTML.

One day, I have to ask her out. There's no other options. And it could be very easy, but I'm not close enough in order for the relationship to seem rushed and not weird.. Before asking her out, I need to build up a friendship. This may be difficult, since the only time I can hang out with her is in Marching Band. This means my chance exists until about November. I don't even know how much time I have, because she's VERY attractive, and one day her fire could run out for me and another guy could ask her out. I need to do something quickly, and I need to take every chance I can get to become closer to her. In other news, I think I'm accidentally leading another girl on. I'm so screwed. There's another girl who is very nice who likes me, but I don't like her nearly as much as I like
