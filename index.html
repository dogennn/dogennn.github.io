<head>Welcome to my website!</head>
<body>
  <h1>My website is crappy and incomplete.</h1>
  <p>I am going to be using this website to practice using HTML. I will also get creative with link designs among other things in order to improve my general programming knowledge.</p>
  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>My name is Ben, I'm a freshman in High School, and I like to play videogames. Some of my favorite games consist of: Overwatch, CS:GO, and Minecraft.<p>
  <p>My dream is to become a Computer Scientist once I graduate from College and have a family.<p>
  <p>There will be more <a href="dogennn.github.io/hub">lists and informative pieces of writing</a> on this website, including subcategories for different pieces of information I upload here. I hope you (sorta) enjoy reading about me.</p>
